## Word Cloud for cat names and dog names

Analysis: It is worth noticing some things:
 * Often we see normal pet names like "Mimi", "Angel" and so on;
 * Quite often people write simply who is there for adoption: "Kitten", "Puppies";
 * Vety often the color of pet is written, sometimes gender;
 * And it seems that sometimes names can be strange or there is some info written instead of the name;
 * One more thing to notice is that some pets don't have names. Let's see whether this is important: rate of unname in python
  * Less than 10% of pets don't have names, but they have a higher possibility of not being adopted.
  * I have noticed that shorter names tend to be meaningless. Here is an example of some names with 3 characters.
  * And here are names with 1 or 2 characters...
