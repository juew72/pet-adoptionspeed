## Here is where we can insert an image:

## How about a link?

And of course some text, and maybe [a link to https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/](https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/)

## Or some code?

Some code might go here:

```
x <- 5 # Here's some R code
```

### Color/ Fee/ Health Condition vs Adoption Speed
```
\{\% include colorfeehealth.html \%\}
```
{% include colorfeehealth.html %}

### Color & Fee & Health Condtion
```
\{\% include others.html \%\}
```
