## Here is where we can insert an image:

![GW Data Science logo](/img/gwdsp.png)

## How about a link?

And of course some text, and maybe [a link to https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/](https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/)

Here is a link to [gender-dog:](https://raw.githack.com/juew72/pet-adoptionspeed/master/gender-dog.html)
What if I just paste the HTML for a plotly plot?

{% include gender-dog.html %}


{% include gender-cat.html %}
