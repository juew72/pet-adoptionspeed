PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction is acquired from Kaggle.com (PetFinder.my, 2019). The original row datasets contain 25 features and 14,993 samples in train.csv and 24 features and 3,972 samples in test.csv. Through the data cleaning process, the cleaned datasets contain 21 features and 14,993 samples in train.csv and 20 features and 3,972 samples in test.csv. In cleaned train dataset, the features are ‘AdoptionSpeed’, ‘Age’, ‘Breed1’, ‘Breed2’, ‘Gender’, ‘Color1’, ‘Color2’, ‘Color3’, ‘MaturitySize’, ‘Fur Length’, ‘Vaccinated’, ‘Dewormed’, ‘Sterilized’, ‘Health’, ‘Quantity’, ‘Fee’, ‘Description’, ‘PetID’, ‘DataType’, and there is no ‘AdoptionSpeed’ variable in test dataset. In the original dataset instructions, breed_labels.csv and color_labels.csv list the number and corresponding breed name or color, so the resulting cleaned dataset removes all number in ‘Breed1’, ‘Breed2’, and 3 color-related columns, and insert the top 5 breed name and all colors correspondingly. The resulting cleaned datasets focus on the top 5 breeds for cats and top 5 breeds for dogs in the ‘Breed1’ variable and change the related integer values in ‘Breed2’ variables, due to the tremendously large amount of breed listed and involved. The top 5 breeds for cat or dog samples cover at least 75% of both test and train datasets together, and many of the other breeds have less than 5 samples per breed name, or even 1 sample per breed name. Besides, variables ‘Type’, ‘MaturitySize’, ‘FurLength’, ‘Vaccinated’, ‘Dewormed’, ‘Sterilized’, and ‘Health’ are all listed as integer from 0 to 3 or 4, so the resulting cleaned datasets also replace the integers with matching values in Python data type of string. A list of features that was applied in this project, associated with the type of data, and a variable description were available in Appendix A. The detailed descriptions of prediction variable ‘AdoptionSpeed’ are listed in Appendix B, noticing that there is not pet data available for adoption speed between 90 and 100 days.
