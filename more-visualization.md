### Maturity Size

{% include maturitysize.html %}

*Analysis:*
The medium size is the most common maturity size among all four sizes for pets. And there are almost no Extra-Large pets. The adoption speed of medium size pets has slightly higher than the others. Since there are 2973 not being adopted medium size pets, which is the largest number in medium size. For both medium and small size pets, it is more likely to be adopted within the 1st month, which is consistent with the results of some other studies (Žák et al., 2015): emphasizes that small dogs and medium dogs have the shortest length of stay and large dogs has the longest length of stay.


### Breed

*Analysis:*
Non-pure pets have higher and faster tendency to be adopted. And most of the dog breeds are not pure breeds but mix breeds. This result is similar to a previous study stated that mixed breeds have higher possibilities to be adopted compared with a specific breed (Němcová & Novák, 2003). Among the popular dog breeds, the top 2 breeds are Poddle and ShihTzu. Both of them are categorized as toy breeds or lapdogs.  (Protopopova et al., 2014) and (Svoboda & Hoffman, 2015) reveal that Shih Tzu is one of the most popular breeds among adopters.

*Analysis:*
* Unlike previous research, which has revealed that yellow dogs have shorter stay in Shelter compared with black dogs (Kay, Coe, Young & Pearl, 2018). The most common colors are black and brown and there are almost no gray or yellow dogs. 

* It is surprising that people prefer to adopt pets neither vaccinated nor sterilized. However, a healthy, dewormed pet tend to be adopted faster. One possible reason might be the pet age. Since most of the quickly adopted pets are less than 6 months, it is not a proper time to make pets fully vaccinated. Even though the dataset shows vaccinated pets are the minority but most of them do have deworming. This might because of veterinarian would recommend deworming pets for newborn pets, who are only 2 to 3 weeks. 

* Lepper et al. (2012) found that pets suffering from injury problems have decreased their possibility to be adopted, probably because of the higher cost for care. Moreover, some adoptions of the injury pets may occur since adopters feel sympathy for these four-leg companions and more likely to take care of them.
