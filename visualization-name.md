*Analysis:*
* the popular pet names are ‘Lucky, ‘Mimi’, ‘Brownie’, etc. There are also type of pets like ‘Kitten’, ‘Puppies’ and even genders ‘Girl’, ‘Boy’.
* there are around 10% of pets do not have names, however, their possibility to be adopted is higher than pets having names. 
* One more interesting finding is that there are some names with only 1 or 2 characters, or some pets’ names are created with symbols, which have no meaning in it. 
* There does not appear to have a direct relationship between if a pet has a name and the adoption speed.
